WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   Inst_control/out_port_no<12> is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <Inst_ddr_control/inst_ddr/memc3_wrapper_inst/mcb_ui_top_inst/mcb_raw_wrapper
   _inst/gen_term_calib.mcb_soft_calibration_top_inst/GLOBAL_LOGIC1> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
